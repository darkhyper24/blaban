## ADR 003: API Gateway Implementation with Fiber

### Context
The system requires a high-performance, easy-to-use routing middleware that can:
- Handle high traffic efficiently
- Provide robust middleware support
- Simplify API management
- Ensure low resource consumption

### Decision
Use Fiber (a Go web framework) as the primary API gateway for the system.

### Detailed Consequences

#### Pros
- **Extremely Low Memory Allocation**:
  - Optimized for performance and low memory footprint
  - Suitable for microservices architecture
  - Faster request processing

- **Near-Native Performance**:
  - Performance close to raw net/http package
  - Minimal overhead compared to other web frameworks
  - Efficient for high-traffic applications

- **Easy to Learn and Use**:
  - Simplified routing and middleware configuration
  - Similar syntax to Express.js for web developers

- **Strong Middleware Support**:
  - Rich ecosystem of middleware
  - Easy to add logging, rate limiting
  - Supports custom middleware development

#### Cons
- **Relatively New Framework**:
  - Limited long-term community support
  - Potential stability concerns
  - Fewer third-party integrations compared to mature frameworks

- **Limited Enterprise-Level Features**:
  - May require custom implementations for complex enterprise requirements
