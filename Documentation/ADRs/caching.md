## ADR 005: Redis Caching Layer

### Context
The system needs to:
- Improve response times
- Reduce database load
- Manage user sessions efficiently
- Enable fast data retrieval

### Decision
Implement Redis as the primary caching mechanism and session management tool.

### Detailed Consequences

#### Pros
- **In-Memory Performance**:
  - Extremely fast read/write operations
  - Microsecond-level response times
  - Reduces database query latency

- **Session Management**:
  - Efficient user authentication storage
  - Supports distributed session handling
  - Easy session tracking

- **High Availability**:
  - Supports clustering
  - Enables distributed caching
  - Provides fault tolerance

#### Cons
- **Cache Invalidation Complexity**:
  - Requires robust cache invalidation strategies
  - Risk of serving stale data
  - Needs careful implementation of cache refresh mechanisms
