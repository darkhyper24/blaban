  - Simplifies maintenance and updates
  - Reduces complexity of other system components

- **Improved Maintainability**:
  - Easier to test and debug
  - Supports individual service updates
  - Allows specialized team focus

#### Cons
- **Increased System Complexity**:
  - More complex inter-service communication
  - Requires sophisticated monitoring
  - Increases deployment complexity

- **Debugging Challenges**:
  - More difficult error tracing
