## ADR 002: OAuth2 Authentication

### Context
The system needs a secure, simple authentication mechanism that:
- Minimizes password management complexity
- Provides a seamless user login experience
- Ensures robust security
- Reduces development overhead for authentication

### Decision
Implement user authentication and authorization using OAuth2 with Google authentication as the primary provider.

### Detailed Consequences

#### Pros
- **Reducing Password Handling Complexities**:
  - Eliminates need for custom password storage and hashing
  - Reduces risk of password-related security vulnerabilities
  - Simplifies user registration and login process

- **Secured Token-Based Authentication**:
  - Uses industry-standard security protocols
  - Provides short-lived access tokens
  - Supports multi-factor authentication


#### Cons
- **Reliance on Third-Party Providers**:
  - Dependent on Google's authentication service availability
  - May require fallback authentication methods
