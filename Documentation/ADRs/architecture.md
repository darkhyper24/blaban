## ADR 001: Microservices Architecture with Golang

### Context
The Blaban Restaurant system requires a robust, scalable, and maintainable software architecture that can:
- Handle increasing customer load
- Allow independent development and deployment of services
- Provide flexibility for future feature additions
- Ensure system reliability and performance

### Decision
Adopt a microservices architecture implemented using Golang (Go), with each service responsible for a specific business capability.

### Detailed Consequences

#### Pros
- **Improved Scalability**: 
  - Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand
  - Enables horizontal scaling of specific system components
  - Allows for targeted resource allocation

- **Independent Service Deployment**:
  - Services can be developed, deployed, and updated separately
  - Reduces risk of system-wide failures
  - Enables continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
  - Supports team autonomy and parallel development

#### Cons
- **Distributed System Challenges**:
  - Increased complexity in service communication
  - Need for advanced error handling and resilience strategies

- **High Cost**:
  - Initial setup and infrastructure can be expensive
  - Requires more sophisticated monitoring and management tools
  - Higher operational overhead

- **Increased Complexity**:
  - More complex system design
  - Requires expertise in distributed systems
  - Increased debugging and tracing complexity
