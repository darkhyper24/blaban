## ADR 004: MongoDB as Primary Database

### Context
The restaurant system requires a flexible, scalable database solution to:
- Store dynamic user data
- Manage restaurant menus
- Handle user reviews
- Support future system growth

### Decision
Choose MongoDB as the primary database for the Blaban Restaurant system.

### Detailed Consequences

#### Pros
- **NoSQL Flexibility**:
  - Schema-less design allows rapid iteration
  - Supports complex, nested document structures
  - Ideal for evolving restaurant menu and user data

- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Native support for distributed databases
  - Can handle large datasets efficiently

- **High Availability**:
  - Replica sets ensure data redundancy
  - Automatic failover mechanisms
  - Supports read scaling through secondary nodes

#### Cons
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Requires careful indexing strategies
  - Potential performance overhead for complex queries
  - May need optimization for read-heavy workloads
